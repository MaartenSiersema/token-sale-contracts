# OriginTrail Tokensale & Token contracts

# Details

The token presale starts on January 15th and lasts for a maximum of 2 weeks. As soon as the presale stops, the token sale continues, all together up to 4 weeks.

The minimum amount to be raised is $5mil, while the maximum cap is $22.5mil. The presale cap is $10mil. The first week of presale entails a 20% discount on the token, while in the second week the discount is %15. During the sale (after presale) the token price is not discounted.

The maximum amount of tokens is 500 000 000. In the case of any remaining (unsold) tokens, they are minted to the OriginTrail wallet and will be redestributed to all token sale contributors proportionally.

The contract defines a minimum and maximum ether investment, to be defined at a later stage. 

The price of TRACE will be pegged to ETH at contract deployment.

A simple vesting functionality is also implemented.
